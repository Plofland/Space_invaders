This is my Space Invader's side project to help me learn Python. The game is functional but boring. Listed below are a few changes that I'd like to make.


TO DO(for a later date when I have time):
  -Make lives smaller in upper left corner
  -Create mouse movement inputs for moving the ship left and right
  -Create mouse click for firing weapon
  -Allow enemies to fire their weapons
